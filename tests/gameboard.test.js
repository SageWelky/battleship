//Gameboard needs to:


//(A):
//Handle two categories:
//Placement phase coordinates for ships,
//Play phase guess coordinates,
//----------------Notes----------------
//Input differentiation should come in the form of two different function calls
//

//(A.1):
//Placement details:



//(B):
//Store board state:
//0 for nothing there,
//-1 for a miss already guessed, and -2 for a hit already guessed,
//1-10 for the corresponding unhit ship,
